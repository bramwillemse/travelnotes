# Travel Notes

This is a working title for a project I've decided to invest some time in. 

This is a prototype for an app in which you can:
- Pick a location
- Add notes
- Share 'em easy as pie! üç∞

Right now I'm building it using:
- Sass (SCSS)
- JS (ES6)
-- Vue.js
-- Fuse.js

## Setup
To build and run this project set the correct local URL in `gulpfile.js/serve.js` (tvn.dev is my default) and run the following terminal commands:
1. `npm install`
2. `gulp`
3. `npm run api`
